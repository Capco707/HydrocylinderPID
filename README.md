# HydrocylinderPID
### Our UI design focuses on the convenience during the process of adjusting the parameters of the PID and the user friendliness during the process of displaying the result curve and measuring. With the help of Unity and C#, we are able to create a graphical interface that enable users to adjust the PID parameters in real time, and control the whole system by software.
